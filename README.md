# InvKine-SCORBOT
Manipulator Modeling using MATLAB's Robotic System Toolbox

MATLABâ€™s computation power comes handy for demonstrating Robotics topics like:
Coordinate Transformation
Forward and Inverse Kinematics of Robotic Arm
Simulating the arm movement
Concept was taken a bit further by building Robot Manipulator using Kinematic DH parameter with the help of Robotic System Toolbox. Students modelled 5-axis SCORBOT robotic arm in MATLAB and simulated it by plotting the inverse kinematic solution.
